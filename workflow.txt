Variogram + equations side by side

Equation: briefly explain what each variable means

Sill as last: 

1. Observation 1: Z(ua)(head) and Z(ua+1)(tail)

	Explain Z(ua), Z(ua+1) - porosity values at a certain position, separated by
	lag distance h. 

	terminology: lag distance (alert) - known as h

	annotate 1 pair

2. Observation 2: N(h)
	
	N(h) denotes for number of all pairs that are separated by distance h.

	annotate 4 pairs

3. Observation 3: gamma(h)

	gamma denotes for variance over distance h. 	

	A single point on variogram is a variance of all pairs that are separated by distance h.
