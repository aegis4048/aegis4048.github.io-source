variogram

	too noisy - accurate, but highly unstable
	too few   - too imprecise for accurate modling. 

	extreme values (outliers needs to be removed)

	natural process do not lead to isotropic spatial distributions
	typically there is a plane of major continuity. 

	Directionality
	
		- in absence of good understanding of the local geologic directionaly,	
		  start with a neutral isotropic model, and combine it with geologic knowledge
		  to decide directionality

	sill and apparent sill

Presence of a nugget means that any two observations 
sampled arbitrarily closely will not necessarily have the same value

The nugget effect is like the random noise. It's just the small scale
variability that you can't estimate with your large scale 
variability model.
