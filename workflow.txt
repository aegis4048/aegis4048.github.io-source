variogram

	too noisy - accurate, but highly unstable
	too few   - too imprecise for accurate modling. 

	extreme values (outliers needs to be removed)

	natural process do not lead to isotropic spatial distributions
	typically there is a plane of major continuity. 

	Directionality
	
		- in absence of good understanding of the local geologic directionaly,	
		  start with a neutral isotropic model, and combine it with geologic knowledge
		  to decide directionality

	sill and apparent sill

Don't forget to transform data into Gaussian space for Gaussian simulation later
