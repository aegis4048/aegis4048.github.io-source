Social_Media_Description: The gap time between drilling and completion has negligible impact on reservoir conditions.
IndexPreview: DUC wells older than 2 years have less than 5% chance of completion and become "Dead" DUCs. However, the study conducted in this article shows that the gap time between drilling and completion has negligible impact on reservoir conditions, at least not significant enough to discourage completion for old DUCs
