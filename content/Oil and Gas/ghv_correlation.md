Social_Media_Description: Anadarko and Permian wells may lose 70% of production if completion is delayed for 200 days.
IndexPreview: In times of unfavorable commodity prices, operators may delay completion after drilling in the hope of a price recovery. The study conducted in this article shows why this may not be a financially sound idea for certain basins by quantifying the impact of DUC time on normalized EURs.
