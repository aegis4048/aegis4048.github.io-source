Social_Media_Description: Predicting VRU Economics/Downsizing Timing For Declining Wells
IndexPreview: Flash gas rates from low-pressure vessels (heaters, VRTs, and tanks) can decline much faster than anticipated, mirroring the rate of oil decline. In some cases, they can drop by half within just 3 to 6 months from IP. This post presents monthly process simulation results that model the decline of flash gas from low-pressure vessels as the well declines. An Excel sheet is also provided to help calculate VRU economics.
