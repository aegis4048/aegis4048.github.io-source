Social_Media_Description: H₂S ppm levels obtained from high P aren't representative at low P.
IndexPreview: H₂S ppm levels obtained from high pressure applications (HP separators) are often re-used for low pressure applications (atmospheric tanks). H₂S levels soar 3~25 times at low pressures. This post explains the thermodynamics behind H2S ppm level variations and provide simulation results summary for practical applications.
