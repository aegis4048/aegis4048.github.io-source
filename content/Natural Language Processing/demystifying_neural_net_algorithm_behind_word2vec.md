Social_Media_Description: How is neural network used in language modeling to capture relationships among words?
IndexPreview: The past couple of years, neural networks in Word2Vec have nearly taken over the field of NLP, thanks to their state-of-art performance. But how much do you understand about the algorithm behind it? This post will crack the secrets behind neural net in Word2Vec.
