Social_Media_Description: Illustrative guidance to outlier-robust linear regression modeling
IndexPreview: In regression, managing outliers is key for accurate predictions. Techniques like OLS can be skewed by outliers. This analysis compares OLS, RANSAC, Huber, and Theil-Sen methods, showing how each deals with outliers differently, using theory and Python examples, to guide the best model choice for different outlier scenarios.
