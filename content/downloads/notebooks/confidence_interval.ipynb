    "\n",
    "If you've taken a science class with lab reports in your highschool or college, you probably had to include measurement error in your lab reports. For example, if you were asked to measure the length of a paper clip with a ruler, you have to include $\\pm0.5 \\,\\text{cm}$ or $\\pm0.05\\,\\text{cm}$ (depending on the spacing of tick marks) to account for the measurement error that shows the precision of your measuring tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on <a href=\"#\">figure (???)</a>, the paper clip seems to be about 2.7 cm long, but we don't know for sure because the tickmarks in the ruler is not precise enough to measure decimal length. However, I can tell with 100% confidence that the paper clip has a length between 2 ~ 3 cm, because the clip is between 2cm and 3cm tickmarks. You record the length of the paper clip in a *range*, instead of a *point estimate*, to account for the uncertainty introduced by the spacing of the tickmarks.\n",

This boils down to the traditional issue of <a href=\"#\">Sample vs Population</a>, due to the cost of obtaining measurement data of a large data set. Uncertainty is introduced in your samples, because you don't know if your samples are 100% representative of the population, free of bias.
