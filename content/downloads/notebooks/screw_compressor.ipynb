    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">Unlike reciprocating compressors, which are multi-stage, screw compressors operate in a single stage with compression ratios as high as 27. For example, at 3,000 feet above sea level (ASL), atmospheric pressure is 13.2 psia. A screw compressor can discharge up to 13.2 x 27 = 356.4 psia (341.7 psig) before reaching its horsepower limit.</div>\n",

    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">Most upstream sales line pressures range between 60–250 psig, which falls within the operating range of screw compressors. When operating within this range, screw compressors outperform reciprocating compressors for three key reasons: 1) fewer moving parts, resulting in lower maintenance and downtime; 2) lower cost; and 3) better handling of fluctuating inlet pressures. Wellsites, unlike plants, often experience significant pressure swings from the wellhead, which reciprocating compressors struggle to manage.</div>\n",

    "    <div class=\"highlights-title\">3. Lubricating (cooling) oil</div>\n",
    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">The lubricating oil in screw compressors serves three critical purposes. First, it provides a sealing between the two helical rotors (refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"\">Section ???</a> for rotor details). This sealing is necessary for compression because the male and female rotors are designed to avoid direct contact. Second, it lubricates the moving parts, reducing friction and wear. Third, it absorbs and dissipates the heat generated during compression. Cooled oil enters the compression chamber, directly contacting the heated and compressed gas. The oil absorbs the heat, exits the chamber, passes through a cooling fan, and re-enters the chamber to continue the cooling cycle. Lubricating oil represents the highest operating cost for screw compressors, as it requires frequent replacement. For a deeper dive into lube oil-related issues, refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#\">Section ???</a>.</div>\n",

    "    <div class=\"highlights-content\">\n",
    "        <p>\n",
    "            Flowrate capacity and horsepower (HP) consumption are influenced by <u><i>(1) suction pressure</i></u>, <u><i>(2) discharge pressure</i></u>, and <u><i>(3) timing gear ratio</i></u>. Typically, discharge pressure cannot be controlled by operators, as it is determined by the sales line pressure. Higher discharge pressures require more horsepower. Increasing suction pressure boosts flowrate capacity but also increases power consumption. While suction pressure cannot be adjusted for atmospheric tanks (as they lack back pressure valves), it can be adjusted for wellheads or vessels like heater treaters, low-pressure separators, or vapor recovery towers (VRTs) using back pressure valves (BPVs). To increase suction pressure and flowrate capacity, raise the BPV setpoint. For vapor recovery on atmospheric tanks or if adjusting the BPV setpoint is not desired, the only alternative is to change the gear ratio by swapping gears (refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"\">Section ???</a> for explanations on gears). Increasing the gear ratio enhances flowrate capacity but also increases HP consumption. <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-1\">Table 1</a> below summarizes the relationships between suction pressure, discharge pressure, gear ratio, flowrate capacity, and HP consumption.\n",
    "        </p>\n",
    "        <p>\n",
    "            Horsepower is another critical factor. Every compressor has a maximum horsepower limit, and operations must stay within this limit. Increasing suction pressure or gear ratios may boost flowrate capacity but can cause the compressor to fail if it exceeds the machine's HP capacity. The scenario highlighted in red in <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#table-2\">Table 2</a> illustrates a compressor running out of HP due to high suction and discharge pressures. In such cases, a larger compressor with a higher HP capacity is required.\n",
    "        </p>\n",
    "        <p>\n",
    "            It's important to note that there is no direct correlation between flowrate and horsepower consumption. For example, if a compressor's maximum flowrate capacity is 500 MCFD, increasing the flowrate from 100 MCFD to 300 MCFD will not affect HP consumption as long as it operates within the designed capacity. However, exceeding the design capacity by increasing suction pressure or gear ratio will result in higher HP demand.\n",

Direct contact between the cooling oil and compressed gas reduces the gas temperature to near 230°F. However, this is still higher than midstream pipeline specifications (120–140°F). The gas is further cooled by an air-cooled fan before discharge. A single fan is used for both gas and lube oil cooling. The fan targets the gas discharge temperature, with the skid PLC adjusting fan RPM to meet the 120°F target. Oil temperature is regulated by a 3-way thermostatic valve set to 230°F, which mixes fan cooled oil and bypassed hot oil to maintain the setpoint. The thermostat valve determines the hot-cold mixing ratio needed to meet the target temperature. This is similar to how a domestic shower controls water temperature.

    "## 2. Screw compressor (core) working principles\n",
    "\n",
    "> **BEFORE YOU READ:** The term \"compressor\" can refer to two things: a complete compressor package, which includes suction/discharge scrubbers, fans, valves, piping, and the \"core\" compressor, or the \"core\" compressor itself. The \"core\" compressor is the part of the package where actual compression occurs, consisting of two helical rotors inside a compression chamber. This section focuses exclusively on the \"core\" compressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of an oil-flooded screw compressor consists of two helical rotors—a male and a female rotor—enclosed within a compression chamber. The rotors are driven by a shaft, which transfers torque from a driver (either a gas engine or an electric motor) to the rotors. A screw compressor can be either <strong>direct-driven</strong> (non-geared) or <strong>gear-driven</strong>. In a direct-driven configuration, the driving shaft is directly connected to the rotor. In a gear-driven configuration, the driving shaft is connected to timing gears, and the shaft linking the gear to the rotor turns the rotor through the gear. In most screw compressor applications, the driving shaft is connected to the male rotor, but in oil-flooded screw compressors used in the oil and gas industry, the shaft is typically connected to the female rotor or gear. The rotor/gear connected to the shaft (e.g., the female rotor) is the one doing the work, while the other rotor/gear (e.g., the male rotor) spins freely as it is driven by the intermeshing action of the female rotor/gear. As the rotors rotate, gas is drawn into the chamber through the suction port. The intermeshing rotors trap and progressively reduce the volume of the gas as it moves along the length of the rotors toward the discharge port. This reduction in volume increases the gas pressure. The chamber is \"flooded\" with lubricating oil, which serves multiple purposes: it seals the gaps between the rotors, lubricates the moving parts, and absorbs the heat generated during compression. The compressed gas, now mixed with oil, exits the chamber and is separated from the oil in a downstream discharge scrubber before being sent to the pipeline, while the lube oil is recirculated back into the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "A screw compressor features twin helical rotors: one with fewer lobes, called the male rotor, and one with more lobes, called the female rotor. In the upstream oil and gas industry, oil-flooded screw compressors typically use a <strong>4:6 (male:female) female-driven design</strong>. For a non-geared, direct-female driven compressor, this means that for every 1,000 RPM of the female rotor, the male rotor will rotate at 1,500 RPM due to the lobe ratio. The driving rotor (female) receives rotational energy from the driver, while the driven rotor (male) is turned by the intermeshing action of the driving rotor. (Note that this RPM ratio and the driven rotor configuration do not apply to geared units. In geared units, the female \"gear\" drives the male \"gear,\" and the male \"rotor,\" connected to the male gear, turns the female rotor.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Properly manufactured rotors in oil-flooded screw compressors should never experience metal-to-metal contact, as this minimizes wear and ensures longevity. The lubricating oil provides a sealing barrier between the rotors, preventing gas from escaping during compression and allowing the rotors to maintain indirect contact through an oil film.

The driving rotor, connected to the driven gear through the axial bearing, will also rotate at 2,000 RPM. Given a lobe ratio of 4:6 (driving rotor:driven rotor), the driven rotor will rotate at 1,333 RPM (since 2,000 RPM × 4/6 = 1,333 RPM). Despite the input shaft having only 1,000 RPM, the driving rotor achieves 2,000 RPM, and the driven rotor achieves 1,333 RPM, resulting in an overall speed increase.

    "## 3. Choice of a Driver: Electric Motor or Gas Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "A driver that turns the driving shaft can be either an electric motor or a gas engine. There are pros and cons for both, such as noise, weight, energy efficiency, safety, etc. However, the primary motivation to choose one model over the other in the upstream oil and gas industry is company policy on emissions and the presence of power. Note that the fuel gas and electricity consumption is negligible compared to the volume of gas being captured with compressors in the oil and gas industry. The gas engines I've seen consumes about 1~2% of the captured gas as fuel gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Presence of Power</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if an operator strongly prefers electric models over gas engines, this preference does not always guarantee the viability of electric model installation. Some facilities lack access to power, or installing a generator may be too expensive. In such cases, the operator is forced to choose a gas engine model due to the lack of alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong><u>Concerns over Emissions</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some companies prioritize minimizing their carbon footprint, while others do not. Those focused on emissions often prefer electric motors, believing electricity is \"cleaner\" than burning natural gas. However, this isn't always true, as 59% of U.S. electricity comes from hydrocarbons (coal and natural gas). Depending on the electricity source, electric motors may not be cleaner than gas engines. For instance, one customer study found gas engines cleaner than electric models due to the lack of \"clean\" electricity source near their facilities."

Larger units, such as Flogistix FX17 or FX20, share a single fan for cooling the discharge gas, lubricating oil, and engine coolant. This design varies depending on the model. The engine coolant is circulated between the engine and the fan to maintain the engine temperature within safe limits. The burned exhaust gas is vented through the top vent line, which is a source of emissions that some companies aim to remove by using electric models. The unit includes an engine oil reserve and an engine oil level maintainer. The maintainer is equipped with an electric switch that sends a shutdown signal to the PLC when the engine oil level is too low. Additionally, though not shown in the photo, the unit is equipped with a solar panel to power the PLC, as the PLC requires electricity.

    "This configuration is fully electric, with the compressor driver, recycle valve, and liquid dump system all powered electrically. It is the simplest design among the four but also the least common. This is because running an electric liquid pump increases operation and maintenance costs compared to a pneumatic liquid dump system. This configuration is typically used when:\n",

    "        <li>It is not easy or feasible to route control valve vent gas to a clean disposal system (most flow control valves vent used pilot gas; refer to <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"\">Section ???</a> for flow control valve details).</li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Both conditions must be satisfied for this configuration to be chosen. While most operators do not prioritize control valve vent gas due to minimal emissions, some companies maintain a zero-tolerance stance on emissions, making this design necessary.\n",

    "<strong><u>Characteristics</u></strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the system uses an electric motor-driven liquid pump for liquid discharge, it does not require complex control valves or pneumatic pilot gas lines to operate a pneumatic dump system. It also eliminates the need for an integrated blowcase inside the suction scrubber. Instead, the system uses two additional liquid level switches (positioned below the high liquid level kill switch) to control the pump. In <a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#fig-15\">Figure 15</a> below, when the liquid level rises above LSH-1000, the switch sends a signal to turn on the pump. The pump operates until the liquid level drops to LSL-1000, at which point it turns off.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this configuration has some downsides. The electric actuator for the recycle valve requires significantly higher maintenance costs and more frequent maintenance compared to a pneumatically operated recycle valve. Additionally, the operational and maintenance costs of the electric pump are higher than those of a pneumatic dump system.\n",

As a result, an electric actuator is used to power the recycle valve. \n",
    "\n",
    "The flow control valves for the pneumatic dump system has the same vent pilot gas issues. However, replacing them with an electric liquid pump is often not desirable due to higher costs and maintenance efforts compared to the competitive advantages of a pneumatic dump system. Therefore, a compromise is made by retaining the pneumatic liquid dump system while using an electric actuator for the recycle valve."

Liquid knockouts fall to the bottom of the scrubber and onto the top of the blowcase. The liquid accumulates on top of the blowcase lid until the level reaches a drain outlet, which allows the liquid to flow downward into the blowcase (V-101). A check valve in the drain piping prevents pressurized gas from backflowing into the suction scrubber during the blowdown cycle.\n",

    "There is not enough liquid in V-101 to trigger the dump cycle yet. The liquid level switch (LS-1010), which triggers the dump cycle, remains closed and does not allow pneumatic supply gas to pass through. This causes fail-close valves (CV-1010 and CV-1011) to remain closed, while the fail-open valve (CV-1001) stays open.\n",

CV-1001 remains open during this phase—it is fail-open, meaning it stays open in the absence of pneumatic supply. The purpose of CV-1001 being open is to ensure the gravitational flow of liquid from V-100 into V-101. Assume the downward-sloping pipe between V-100 and V-101 has a 1-ft height difference between the inlet and outlet. With a liquid density of 0.3 psi/ft in the suction scrubber, a 0.3 psi gravitational hydrostatic head drives the liquid from V-100 into V-101. If some of the liquid in V-101 vaporizes (highly likely due to the volatile nature of the liquids for compressor applications) because of conditional changes, the vapors accumulate and pressurize V-101. While the check valve prevents these volatile vapors from backflowing into V-100, the liquid accumulating in the suction scrubber will be unable to flow downward into V-101 due to the higher pressure vapors of V-101 blocking the other side of the check valve. It is important to note that the absence or failure of CV-1001 can trigger a high-level kill (LSHH-1000) because the liquids in V-100 cannot flow down to V-101.\n",

While the coalescer captures most of the entrained oil, tiny fraction of oil is lost to a gas line over time, requiring periodic oil refils. Also, lube oil contamination (due to gas condensate mixing) decreases viscosity of lube oil, causing less oil to be captured by the coalescing element.
