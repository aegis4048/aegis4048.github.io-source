    "Laboratory composition analysis of natural gas always includes \"Plus\" fractions, typically denoted as \"Hexanes+ (C6+)\" or \"Heptanes+ (C7+),\" representing all compounds equal to or heavier than hexane or heptane. For extended chromatograph analysis, labs might report compounds up to n-Decane (C10H22) and group heavier fractions as \"Decanes+ (C10+).\" The use of plus fractions stems from the limitations of chromatograph devices, which detect only a predefined set of pure compounds. Given the presence of potentially more than 100 different compounds, each with less than 0.1% mole fraction, it is impractical to determine the exact mole fractions of all compounds and convenient to input them into equation-of-state (EOS) software. Hence, the plus fractions are used. However, because a plus fraction is a pseudo-compound, it has no designated values for molecular weight ($MW$), critical pressure ($P_c$) and temperature ($T_c$), density ($\\rho$), viscosity ($\\mu$), or acentric factor ($\\omega$), which are some of the required parameters for EOS modeling. *Characterization* of the plus fraction is needed to assign such properties for EOS modling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In <a href=\"https://www.bre.com/ProMax-Upstream.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">BRE ProMax</a>, a leading process simulation software in the upstream oil and gas industry, characterizing a plus fraction requires at least the normal boiling point or a combination of both molecular weight and liquid specific (or API) gravity (<a href=\"#fig-2\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 2</a>). Although the normal boiling point is preferred for characterizing plus fractions<sup><a class=\"internal-link\" href=\"#id1\" id=\"id11\">[1]</a> pg.144</sup>, distillation data is seldom reported for surface facility modeling (this may be different for PVT sims for downhole reservoir simulation). Thus, for tasks such as C6+ or C7+ characterization, both molecular weight and liquid specific gravity are necessary. Unfortunately, real life lab reports don't always come with both $MW$ and liquid specific gravity data for the plus fractions. <u><strong>However, they always report gross heating values (GHV), which can be empircially correlated to calculate $MW$ and liquid density. </strong></u>"

    "<a href=\"#fig-3\" class=\"internal-link\">Figure 3</a> below presents real-life gas sample analyses obtained from atmospheric tanks (Type 1 and 4), a high-pressure separator at 690 psig (Type 2), and a gas salesline operating at 58 psig (Type 3). Types 1 and 2 do not report liquid density, as the original samples were in a gaseous phase. Typically, gas samples report gas specific gravity, while liquid samples report liquid specific (or API) gravity. Since process simulation software requires liquid specific gravity, it can be correlated from the GHV values, discussed in more detail <a href=\"#\" class=\"internal-link\">below</a>. Additionally, Type 2 lacks properties of the plus fractions, which can be computed using the molecular weighted average of known compounds. Type 3 includes calculated $MW$ and liquid specific gravity, suitable for direct input for C7+ characterization, although these values are not measured but computed by making assumptions about the compositions of the plus fractions. For C7+, it's reasonable to assume a 50% mix of n-hexane (C6H14) and n-heptane (C7H16) for natural gas samples. Type 4 explicitly outlines assumptions for the composition of the plus fraction. In this scenario, explicit characterization of the plus fraction is unnecessary; users can redistribute the mole fraction of the plus fraction (1.472%) based on the ratio of assumed compounds (C6-60%, C7-30%, C8-10%)."
