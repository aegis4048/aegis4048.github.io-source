    "If you’ve ever tried to do anything with data provided to you in PDFs, you know how painful it is — it's hard to copy-and-paste rows of data out of PDF files. It's especially hard if you want to retain the formats of the data in PDF file while extracting text. Most of the open source PDF parsers available are good at extracting text. But when it comes to retaining the the file's structure, eh, not really. Try [tabula-py](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py) to extract data into a CSV or Microsoft Excel spreadsheet using a simple, easy-to-use interface. One look is worth a thousand words. Take a look at the demo screenshot.\n",

    "This installation tutorial assumes that you are using Windows operating system. However, according to the offical [tabula-py documentation](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py#os), it was confirmed that tabula-py works on macOS and Ubuntu. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Download Java**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabula-py is a wrapper for tabula-java, which translates Python commands to Java commands, so that us Python programmers don't have to bother learning Java. As the name \"tabula-java\" suggests, it requires Java. You can download Java [here](https://www.java.com/en/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Set environment PATH variable (Windows)**\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I don't like about Windows is that it's difficult to use a new program I downloaded in a console environment like Python or CMD window. But oh well, if you are a Windows user, you have to go through this extra step to allow Python to use Java. If you are a macOS or Ubuntu user, you probably don't need this step. \n",

    "## Tabula Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "Tabula supports web application to parse PDF files. You do not need this to use tabula-py, but from my personal experience I strongly recommend you to use this tool because it really helps you debugging issues when using tabula-py. For example, I was tring to parse 100s of PDF files at once, and for some reason tabula-py would return an <code>NoneType</code> object instead of <code>pd.DataFrame</code> object (by default, tabula-py extracts tables in dataframe) for one PDF file. There was nothing wrong with my codes, and yet it would just not parse the file. So I tried opening it on the tabula web-app, and realized that it was actually a scanned PDF file and that tabula is unable to parse scanned PDFs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Long stort shot, if it can be parsed with tabula web-app, you can replicate it with tabula-py. If tabula web-app can't, you should look for a different tool to meet your need.\n",

    "**Installations**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already configured the environment PATH variable for Java, all you need to do is downloading the .zip file [here](https://tabula.technology/) and running <code>tabula.exe</code>. That's it. Tabula has really nice web-interface in which you can parse tables from PDFs by just clicking buttons.\n",
